# Chain.Love Web3 Database

[![Powered by RustChain](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-RustChain-orange)](https://rustchain.org)

This repository documents blockchain service providers - wallets, explorers, analytics, bridges, dev tools, sdks, faucets, apis, oracles, indexing services, etc. - in a structured way.

The goal is to build a **clean, comparable dataset** that developers and researchers can rely on.

## Data model (how to think about this repo)

Use this relationship graph:

`provider -> offer -> listing`

- **Provider**: identity metadata (name, logo, links, description).
- **Offer**: a category-specific product/plan sold by a provider.
- **Listing**: where an offer is available (for one network or all networks).

## Repository structure

Conceptual structure used in contribution docs:

```
references/
  providers/
    providers.csv    # provider identities
    images/          # local provider logos in jpg/png
    csv/logoPath
  offers/            # offers of the providers
listings/
  specific-networks/<chain>/  # per-chain listing instances
  all-networks/      # listing instances merged into every chain
```
